Graphical Abstract Creation Prompt

-----------------------
Objective:
Create a graphical abstract as a 1536x1024 pixel (3:2 aspect ratio) image (JPG/PNG) that visually summarizes the key aspects of the given research paper, based only on the provided text file.

IMPORTANT: The text file is the only source of content. The accompanying JPG images are style references only. Do not copy or adapt content from the example image.
-----------------------
Provided Files:
1. Text file containing extracted content from the research paper
  - Includes: Title, Authors & DOI, Published Year, Abstract, Methods, and Results
2. JPG images:
  - Template layout – for positioning and structural guide only
  - Example image – for visual styling reference only (not for content reuse)

-----------------------
Workflow:
1. Paper Analysis (Semi-automated – for user confirmation) - Extract the following elements from the text file (includes title, authors & DOI, published year, abstract, methods, and results only):
1) Article Title
- Use full title exactly as in the paper
2) Authors, Published Date & DOI  
- Use only the first author's last name and first initial, followed by “et al.”  
- Format the author line as:  
  LastName FirstInitial et al., Published: Month DD, YYYY  
  https://doi.org/...
- The part up to "Published:" should appear in bold, and the publication date and DOI in regular font.  
- Ensure the bold and regular text appear on the same line, not separated.
3) Key Results / Conclusions
- Up to 3 bullet points summarizing main results or findings
- Total word count: no more than 75 words across all bullet points
4) Visual Element (Medical Image, Illustration, or Graphical Representation)
- Create a new, medically accurate visual that effectively conveys the core clinical or scientific message of the paper.
- The generated visual should summarize the central concept or result, as best understood from the available abstract, methods, and results sections (not just a single figure).
- Do not include bar charts, line graphs, or statistical visualizations. Instead, present key numerical outcomes as clearly written text or labels.
- Add contextual annotations for clarity when necessary:
  - Use arrows, outlines, or brief labels to highlight key features or findings
  - Keep labeling concise, relevant, and visually clean
- Do not include decorative or abstract symbols—focus on clinical relevance and interpretability.
- Avoid anatomical annotations unless essential for the clarity of the visual. Focus on illustrating the central message rather than depicting anatomical structures.

2: User Confirmation
Present the extracted elements above to the user for review.
Wait for explicit confirmation (e.g., “Looks good”, “Proceed”, or user edits).
Only then proceed to graphical design.

3. Graphical Abstract Design
Create a 1536x1024 px landscape image that visually represents the research paper using the Radiology (RSNA)-style graphical abstract format. Follow the layout structure and design guidelines below to ensure clarity, medical relevance, and visual professionalism.
1) Layout Structure
- Top Center: Article title (bold, blue, centered)
- Left Side: Visual element based on a key figure from the paper
- Right Side: Key results or conclusions (≤75 words, bullet points allowed)
- Bottom Bar (Light Sky Blue #E8F0F2): Author line, publication date, DOI, and Radiology logo
2) Image & Composition
- Dimensions: Exactly 1536x1024 px, landscape format
- Layout must follow RSNA structure (Title top, Visual left, Results right, Footer bottom)
- Maintain ample white space; avoid grid boxes or icon-based blocks
- Ensure a clean, balanced layout free from clutter
3) Background
- Main background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Bottom footer bar: Light sky blue (#E8F0F2), spanning the full image width
4) Typography
- Font: Open Sans
- Title: Bold, #30549D, centered
- Key Findings: SemiBold, black; use dark blue (#30549D) to highlight important numbers or clinical terms  
- Bottom Bar Text:
  - First line format: LastName FirstInitial et al., Published: Month DD, YYYY  
    - The portion up to “Published:” should be bold  
    - The date should appear in regular font, on the same line  
  - Second line: DOI in regular font (e.g., https://doi.org/...)  
  - All text should be black, legible at actual image size, and properly spaced
5) Visual Element
- Recreate one key figure from the paper (may be AI-generated if conceptually accurate)
- Maintain clinical and scientific accuracy
- Use labeling for clarity when necessary
  - Arrows, outlines, or brief labels can be used to highlight key features or findings, but avoid anatomical annotations unless essential.
- Keep the visual medically relevant and professional

6) Radiology Logo  
- The Radiology logo must be horizontally aligned with the footer text and placed at the far right end of the same line.
- It should be proportionally scaled and vertically aligned with the text  
- Use a high-resolution version with clear margins  
- Use a transparent or white-background logo to match the footer design
-----------------------
Final Deliverable:
A professional, medical-scientific graphical abstract image (JPG/PNG, 1536x1024) that visually communicates the study title, core findings, and one key figure, designed in accordance with the Radiology (RSNA) graphical abstract style and layout conventions.
